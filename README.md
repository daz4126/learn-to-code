## Intro, programming, pseudocode

##  Python vs Js (
technical, general use, development - for work/jobs

## First program 
(Hello World - console.log vs print

## Variables

Do we find python equivalent? Or just do we just do programming and ignore this part completely?

## Data structure methods
map, filter, reduce etc

Closures, Pure functions, Higher order functions, currying
There's the [article we wrote about functional programming](https://www.sitepoint.com/make-javascript-functional/) as well

## OOP
mainly python

## Times/Dates
Date objects
setTimeout and setInterval

## Async programming
Await and promises

## Becoming a Developer
Using GitHub and deployment, testing, linting, using VS Code
